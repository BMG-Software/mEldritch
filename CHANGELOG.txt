# CHANGELOG #

Build 128

- removed the unreversible "remove HUD" thing, replaced it by something
  reversible. You can now remove the HUD (C-H) or hands and HUD (C-S-H),
  and restore them again (S-H). Useful for screenshots or videos.
- In the editor you can now select the voxel set you want to build your
  level for. No need any more to go into the world you want to build a
  level for. This is bound to F2, so F2 does not close the current subtool
  any more. Instead F2, F3 and F4 now toggle their subtools.
- changed save file extension so that meldritch save files don't clash with
  eldritch save files. They're not backwards compatible.
- changed log file name to meldritch-log.txt
- the editor now remembers the location of the file you last saved or loaded.
  Even across sessions.
- added a new book in the library which will let you select world style mods
  (sth like MoM) to play. Check out the SampleWorld mod for more info.
- added PNG as valid format for textures in addition to the already supported
  TGA and BMP.
- added a world style mod. It's ugly and there's nothing to do but run through
  it, but it illustrates how do make a new world for mEldritch.
